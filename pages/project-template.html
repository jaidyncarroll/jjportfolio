        In 2023, I created a videogame with my partner Akari. It was made as a first semester senior project in App Academy. 
        We wanted our game to feature adventure, obstacle courses, and cats!
      </p>
      <p class="section-body">
        This project was built in Godot using GDScript. We drew the characters and used the AI image generator in Canva for the backgrounds.

            I drew the enemy dog and used AI to create the various backgrounds throughout the game.
            When developing the game, I mainly worked on the actions of the player and enemies, including 
            walking left and right, jumping, attacking, and animations. I also helped design the obstacle courses
            that Pumpkin would go through while avioding enemies.

            My classmate Akari drew the main character, Pumpkin
            the cat, as well as the villager cat that helps the player get started at 
            the beginning of the game. Akari developed other mechanics of gameplay
            such as the player losing hearts when attacked, eating fish to gain hearts, and starting over when all of 
            their hearts are gone.

            This project required us to come up with an idea for a videogame.
            Then we had to draw every character and object we wanted to use. Finally,
            we needed to use these assets to develop a fun and creative
            game in Godot.

        We created a storyboard to come up with the story and structure of our game.
        We had to decide whether we wanted a game that featured more fighting or obstacle courses.

        After brainstorming some more, we ultimately decided that we wanted to...

            A lot of the team liked the simplicity of the navigation menu and
            information architecure, noting it was really easy to find
            everything and navigate through the website. <br /><br />
            Team members also liked the use of a grid layout for past
            newsletters and how simple the subscribe feature was.
            <br /><br />
            But in terms of the color & typography choices, the team was
            divided.

            The designer explained she was trying to resemble the colors and
            style of a vintage newspaper. But other members argued that the
            colors should be more aligned with the newsletter brand colors -
            purples, blues, and greens. In a survey that our head of outreach
            posted on Instagram, the majority agreed to make the switch to a
            cooler color palette.

        For the final design, we kept some of the features from the initial
        design - such as the navigation bar, most of the navigation labels, and
        the simple subscription form. We also kept the grid layout to display
        past newsletters. <br />
        <br />
        We did change the color scheme to a combination of purples and blues,
        which better matched our other brand and social media materials. We
        added an additional page for events and moved the subscription form to
        the home page.
        <br />
        <br />
        The website was built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form posts the
        submitted emails to a google sheets, using a custom API built using the
        platform SheetDb. The website is deployed through Vercel.
