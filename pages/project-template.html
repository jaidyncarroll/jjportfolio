      <p class="section-body">
        In 2023, I created a videogame with my partner Akari. It was made as a first semester senior project in App Academy. 
        We wanted our game to feature adventure, obstacle courses, and cats!
      </p>
      <p class="section-body">
        This project was built in Godot using GDScript. We drew the characters and used the AI image generator in Canva for the backgrounds.

            I drew the enemy dog and used AI to create the various backgrounds throughout the game.
            When developing the game, I mainly worked on the actions of the player and enemies, including 
            walking left and right, jumping, attacking, and animations. I also helped design the obstacle courses
            that Pumpkin would go through while avioding enemies.

            My classmate Akari drew the main character, Pumpkin
            the cat, as well as the villager cat that helps the player get started at 
            the beginning of the game. Akari developed other mechanics of gameplay
            such as the player losing hearts when attacked, eating fish to gain hearts, and starting over when all of 
            their hearts are gone.

            This project required us to come up with an idea for a videogame.
            Then we had to draw every character and object we wanted to use. Finally,
            we needed to use these assets to develop a fun and creative
            game in Godot.

      <p class="section-title">The Initial Design</p>
      <p class="section-body">
        We created a storyboard to come up with the story and structure of our game.
        We had to decide whether we wanted a game that featured more fighting or obstacle courses.
      </p>
      <p class="section-body">
        After brainstorming some more, we ultimately decided that we wanted to create an obstacle course
        game that the main character has to go through while avoiding enemy dogs.

        <div>
          <p class="sbs-right" style="width: 265px">
            In our storyboard, Akari and I decided that our game would have an introduction,
            and three levels. <br /><br />
            More specifically, the game would start with an introduction in the village from 
            a friendly cat! The levels would take place in a forest, a dark forest, and a cave.
            <br /><br />
            For the story of the game, we decided that our main character named Pumpkin the cat
            would go through obstacle courses to save the world from evil dogs. This game was definitely
            created by two cat people :)

            Before developing the game, we had to spend a few weeks drawing
            everything that we needed to use as well as their different animations.
            These included Pumpkin, the villager cat, the enemy dog, hearts, fish to 
            recover hearts, and tilesheets.

        Our game came together in the end! We got all of the mechanics of the game to work
        such as the animations, allowing the player to control Pumpkin with the arrow keys,
        and connecting the different levels together.
