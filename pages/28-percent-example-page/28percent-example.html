      <p class="section-body">
        I joined the 28% Newsletter my freshman year of high school, hoping to aid in 
        the newsletter's goal of promoting women in STEM. We created monthly newsletters
        that included interviews of women in the STEM field, articles about past female
        scientists, and more!
      </p>
      <p class="section-body">
        In 10th grade, I created a website for this club with a team of four people. This
        website would allow the club to receive more subscribers to the newsletter and
        to promote their agenda.

            On this project, I worked with three other students in my App Academy
            class. Our team consisted of two front-end designers and two back-end developers.
            All of us conducted research in order to better develop a website to meet 
            the client's needs, and came up with an initial design.

            I acted as a designer and front-end developer, coming up with color schemes,
            choosing fonts, putting together a cohesive layout using HTML and CSS.

            Our client wanted a website that would allow people to subscribe to receive
            the montly newsletter via email. We were also required to show all of past
            newsletters as well as more information about the club.

        I along with the other primary designer came up with a color scheme for the 
        website as well as fonts to use. Then the team developed an initial prototype
        on figma.

            We designed different versions of the website so that we 
            would have options to choose from. We wanted to create the best
            user experience possible. <br /><br />
            In order to make sure we acheived this, we held focus groups and conducted
            research to see how our website's design was received by others. 
            <br /><br />
            But in terms of the color & typography choices, the team was
            divided.

            The designer explained she was trying to resemble the colors and
            style of a vintage newspaper. But other members argued that the
            colors should be more aligned with the newsletter brand colors -
            purples, blues, and greens. In a survey that our head of outreach
            posted on Instagram, the majority agreed to make the switch to a
            cooler color palette.

      <p class="section-title">The Final Design</p>
      <p class="section-body">
        For the final design, we kept some of the features from the initial
        design - such as the navigation bar, most of the navigation labels, and
        the simple subscription form. We also kept the grid layout to display
        past newsletters. <br />
        <br />
        We did change the color scheme to a combination of purples and blues,
        which better matched our other brand and social media materials. We
        added an additional page for events and moved the subscription form to
        the home page.
        <br />
        <br />
        The website was built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form posts the
        submitted emails to a google sheets, using a custom API built using the
        platform SheetDb. The website is deployed through Vercel.
