      <p class="section-body">
        I joined the 28% Newsletter my freshman year of high school, hoping to aid in 
        the newsletter's goal of promoting women in STEM. We created monthly newsletters
        that included interviews of women in the STEM field, articles about past female
        scientists, and more!
      </p>
      <p class="section-body">
        In 10th grade, I created a website for this club with a team of four people. This
        website would allow the club to receive more subscribers to the newsletter and
        to promote their agenda.

            On this project, I worked with three other students in my App Academy
            class. Our team consisted of two front-end designers and two back-end developers.
            All of us conducted research in order to better develop a website to meet 
            the client's needs, and came up with an initial design.

            I acted as a designer and front-end developer, coming up with color schemes,
            choosing fonts, putting together a cohesive layout using HTML and CSS.

            Our client wanted a website that would allow people to subscribe to receive
            the montly newsletter via email. We were also required to show all of past
            newsletters as well as more information about the club.

      <p class="section-body">
        I along with the other primary designer came up with a color scheme for the 
        website as well as fonts to use. Then the team developed an initial prototype
        on figma.

            We designed different versions of the website so that we 
            would have options to choose from. We wanted to create the best
            user experience possible. <br /><br />
            In order to make sure we acheived this, we held focus groups and conducted
            research to see how our website's design was received by others. 
            <br /><br />
            We adjusted the design of our website based off of this research so that
            we could create the best user experience possible.

            Once we updated our design, we conducted one more round of research
            to get as much feedback as possible. After some more research and updates
            to our design, we presented our prototype to our client!

      <p class="section-title">The Final Design</p>
      <p class="section-body">
        For the final design, we kept most of the features from our original
        design including the color scheme and general layout. <br />
        <br />
        When we built the website itself we had to change the sizing of certain
        elements and make the layout of the past newsletters page a little more simple.
        These changes made our design look good and function even better as a website. 
        <br />
        <br />
        The website was built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When a user subscribes
        to the newsletter on the website, submitted emails are posted to a google sheets, 
        using a custom API built using the platform SheetDb. The website is deployed through 
        Vercel.
